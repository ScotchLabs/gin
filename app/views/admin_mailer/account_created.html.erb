Greetings and salutations.
Somebody going by the name of <%= @user.name %> just created an account over at snstheatre.org. Your mission is to <a href='http://snstheatre.org/users'>head over there</a>, figure out what they hell this person wants, and the easiest way to make this little 'problem' go away.
Good luck, administrator.
