Hey there!
Wow, I've written a lot of emails today. This is the last one I think though. I can't wait till I'm finished with it. Then I can go to bed.
Oh, yeah! I remember what I was supposed to tell you:
Your password at snstheatre.org has been reset.
The new password is <%= @pwd %> . Guard it with your life. Also use it to log in at http://snstheatre.org/admin .
Bedtime!
